    <i>"I have spent over 11 years in VIVEKA. When I look back upon my years in the school, I remember, at first, a 3–4-year-old shy, reserved, 
    and timid girl- someone who was scared to open up, to ask doubts, to express herself. The next things that come to my mind are different competition all of which helped me reduce my stage fright and gain confidence. I will forever be grateful to VIVEKA for giving me numerous opportunities, helping me discover my strengths, and giving me the confidence that I badly needed. When I look back at my I cannot believe how fast time has flown. I will forever cherish this entire journey of memories filled with wonderful teachers and amazing classmates. Needless to say, I have had a remarkable experience in VIVEKA which I’m sure will help me face the outside world confidently!

   <p><i>"I have spent over 13 years in VIVEKA both school and college. I have been in VIVEKA since nursery and this place has given good memories and experiences. I have learnt so much from teachers, fellow peers and other students. VIVEKA has taught me good habits as well as right and rational thinking. It has made me duty-bound and obedient. The teachers here are so calm and patient. They have always had the students’ backs and helped them with anything they needed. They pushed us forward to be a better version of ourselves and were so friendly and committed to teaching us. The memories I have made in VIVEKA are unforgettable. School was the best part of everyday for me. VIVEKA has been great and I’ll miss it.
